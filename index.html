<p>Hello, my name is Helen. I am a Mathematics Major at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I like knitting, math, and knitting math. I am very passionate about the intersection between mathematics, knitting, and computer science. I enjoy representing mathematical concepts in knitting and vice versa. I have experience in web development (you're looking at it!), functional programming, and designing algorithms, if you consider knitwear to be an algorithm (which I do). I can be contacted at lars5188 at umn.edu.</p>
<p>For more information about my knitting, check out my Ravelry page and "Why Knitting?".</p>
