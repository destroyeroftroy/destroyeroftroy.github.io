<h2>About Me!</h2>
<p>My name is Helen. I love Star Trek, knitting, mathematics, and learning new things. I currently work in retail as a shift manager, but would like to develop my technical skills and go back to school to finish my bachelors degree in mathematics. I am particularly interested in the intersection between math, knitting, and computer science. I am looking for a job that will let me utilize my interpersonal and technological skills to make the world a better place.</p>
